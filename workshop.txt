description=NOTICE 2025-07-07: Regarding Controversy in the Comments
description=
description=I am completely OK with criticism of the mod, it helps me figure out what to do better. I understand the subject matter is a little uncomfortable for some people to engage with and I'm OK with a little gamer talk in that regard. I created this mod with respectful intent and to be as accurate as I can and with what I know and within the limitations of the game.
description=
description=Nearly 50% of our population have no choice but to deal with this completely natural biological cycle and it shouldn't be a weird taboo subject. Women do exist, and they do not have cooties, grow up please.
description=
description=What I'm NOT OK with is sexism and or misogyny. I will keep all comments critical of me and the mod, but going forward, I'll be deleting comments I deem to be sexist, misogynist or otherwise excessively immature.
