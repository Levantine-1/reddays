description=- Only female characters will experience the menstrual cycle by default, but you can enable for all genders in sandbox options
description=- This should be safe to add mid save, however feminine hygiene items won't spawn in places you've already looted and they don't spawn on zombies at this time.
description=- The follicular, ovulation and luteal phase doesn't have any other effect besides generating discharge, which is completely a visual thing with no status effects that requires a 1-2 times a day change of panty liner.

description=NOTICE 2025-07-07: Regarding Controversy in the Comments
description=
description=I am completely OK with criticism of the mod, it helps me figure out what to do better. I understand the subject matter is a little uncomfortable for some people to engage with and I'm OK with a little gamer talk in that regard. I created this mod with respectful intent and to be as accurate as I can and with what I know and within the limitations of the game.
description=
description=Nearly 50% of our population have no choice but to deal with this completely natural biological cycle and it shouldn't be a weird taboo subject. Women do exist, and they do not have cooties, grow up please.
description=
description=What I'm NOT OK with is sexism and or misogyny. I will keep all comments critical of me and the mod, but going forward, I'll be deleting comments I deem to be sexist, misogynist or otherwise excessively immature.
